## DATA SET
We utilize 91 images which are the common usage in CS training. We crop these images into the size of 96*96. We test our model in three dataset: SET11, BSD68 and MICCAI 2013(MRI).
## TRAIN
* just 
```
$ python MAC_Net_train.py
```
## TEST
```
$ python MAC_Net_test.py
```

## Other things
Other details will be added.
